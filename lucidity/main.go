	Usage: `
Lucidity is a server that records the state of a fleet of Mettle workers.

Essentially the workers periodically report their current state to it; it exists simply to
make it easy to keep an eye on the state of a distributed fleet of them.

Lucidity carries on with the somewhat overdone naming scheme, referring to having a
quality of being able to think or express something clearly. If we need a video game reference
to go along with Zeal, then it could refer to the GTA Lucidity in FreeSpace 2.
